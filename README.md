# ARM_ASM
This is a repo of assembly code for ARM based microcontroller 







# Compiler

There are several compiler used in this repo:

1. aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc 
2. arm-none-eabi-gcc



# Legacy

Although the main goal of this repo is for evaluating ARMv8 assembly code, i still create another folder for making a comparison between legacy arm architecture(V5TE) and new arm architecture.
