# Introduction

This is the lecture for day0.  In this chapter, we will compile our first application and analyze it.

Supported device

- M0+
- M3
- M4

Before you dig, is recommended to read the following material published by ARM education first. It will take you about 1~2 hours to read the above lectures.

## Takeaway

you should know that the compilation is an essential knowledge for programming.

Generally, the memory space layout in Cortex-M base CPU is as follows.

![image-20240728155537428](../png/memory_space.png)

For Cortex-m based CPU, the first word in code region is stack top, while the next is Reset entry which contains the address of the first instruction in an application.

##  Stack

â€‹       In  the Cortex M-series processor, the first word in the vector table corresponds to the stack that the processor operates within. This allows developers to specify the address where the processor pushes or pops register data.    



## section 1

Build the project by the following commands (ignore the warnings):

```
arm-none-eabi-as -c start.s -o start.o
arm-none-eabi-ld start.o -Ttext=0 -o example.elf
```



## section 2

solve warning Issue:

In the previous section, we got the following  error when linking

```
warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 00000000
```

create a new linker script called  `link.ld` (already exists)

```
ENTRY(vector_start)
```

specify that the linker flags link to a linker file by  `-Tlink.ld`

```
arm-none-eabi-as -c start.s -o start.o
arm-none-eabi-ld start.o -Tlink.ld -o example.elf
```



## Section 3 (optional)

### Question

There are some questions in `start.s`

```assembly
.thumb                                // Q0
.section .text                        // Q1

.global vector_start                   //Q2
vector_start:
stack_top: .word 0x00000000            //Q3
reset_entry: .word Reset_Handler + 1   //Q4
reserved: .space 0x400                 //Q5

Reset_Handler:                         
    nop     
    b Reset_Handler     //Infinite loop.
```



Q0: what does `.thumb` stands for in assembly code?

Q1: what does `.section .text` stands for in assembly code?

Q2: what does `.global` stands for in assembly code?

Q3: why  do we set stack_top at the 0x00000000 ?

Q4: why the reset entry can be represented by  the address of Reset_handler  plus 1?

Q5: why do we reserve 1k-bytes space after the reset entry?





##  Compiler Flags

Generally, in order to tell the compiler that what type of cpu arch which we program in the project , we may add some flags when compile the code.

```
arm-none-eabi-as -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m0plus -c start.s -o start.o  # for Cortex-m0+
arm-none-eabi-as -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m3 -c start.s -o start.o  # for Cortex-m3
arm-none-eabi-as -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4 -c start.s -o start.o  # for Cortex-m4
```
